# dataStructures
A collection of data structures that I've created to document, maintain, and improve upon.


data structures that are a Work In Progress (Not fully tested or implemented):

- HashMap.java          (Not fully tested)
- RedBlackTree.java     (Not fully implemented)

Files that are working but need maintainence (throws compiler warnings):

- BST.java          (Type safety and Unchecked casts)
- BSTTest.java      (Deprecated method, Type safety, and Unchecked casts)
